This is a small shooting game based on A-Frame WebVR. 
I created this game using the [Supermedium aframe-super-shooter-kit](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-super-shooter-kit "Supermedium aframe-super-shooter-kit") and [environment component](https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component) as starting points, plus benscott's [aframe-viewable-component](https://github.com/benscott/aframe-viewable-component) and the animation-mixer component, part of aframe-extras by Don McCurdy. My inspiration comes from
[Danilo Pasquariello's work](https://thedart76.github.io/aframe-gear-of-war-desktop/). Thank you guys!
